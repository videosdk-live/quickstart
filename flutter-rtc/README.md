## Key Concepts

- `Meeting` - A Meeting represents Real time audio and video communication.

  **`Note : Don't confuse with Room and Meeting keyword, both are same thing üòÉ`**

- `Sessions` - A particular duration you spend in a given meeting is a referred as session, you can have multiple session of a particular meetingId.
- `Participant` - Participant represents someone who is attending the meeting's session, `local partcipant` represents self (You), for this self, other participants are `remote participants`.
- `Stream` - Stream means video or audio media content that is either published by `local participant` or `remote participants`.

<br/>

## Android Permission

Add all the following permissions to AndroidManifest.xml file.

```
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />
    <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

## iOS Permission

Add the following entry to your Info.plist file, located at `<project root>/ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Camera Usage!</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) Microphone Usage!</string>
```

<br/>

## Token Generation

Token is used to create and validate a meeting using API and also initialise a meeting.

üõ†Ô∏è `Development Environment`:

- For development, you can use temporary token. Visit VideoSDK [dashboard](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys) to generate temporary token.

üåê `Production Environment`:

- For production, you have to set up an authentication server to authorize users. Follow our official example repositories to setup authentication server, [videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples](https://github.com/videosdk-live/videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples)

<br/>

## API: Create and Validate meeting

- `create meeting` - Please refer this [documentation](https://docs.videosdk.live/api-reference/realtime-communication/create-room) to create meeting.
- `validate meeting`- Please refer this [documentation](https://docs.videosdk.live/api-reference/realtime-communication/validate-room) to validate the meetingId.

<br/>

## [Initialize a Meeting](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/api/sdk-reference/videosdk-class/methods#createroom)

- You can initialize the meeting using `createRoom()` method. `createRoom()` will generate a new `Room` object and the initiated meeting will be returned.

```js
  Room room = VideoSDK.createRoom(
        roomId: "abcd-efgh-ijkl",
        token: "YOUR TOKEN",
        displayName: "GUEST",
        micEnabled: true,
        camEnabled: true,
        defaultCameraIndex: 1,
      );
```

<br/>

## [Mute/Unmute Local Audio](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/mic-controls)

```js
// unmute mic
room.unmuteMic();

// mute mic
room.muteMic();
```

<br/>

## [Enable/Disable Local Webcam](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/camera-controls)

```js
// enable webcam
room.enableCam();

// disable webcam
room.disableCam();
```

<br/>

## [Leave or End Meeting](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/guide/video-and-audio-calling-api-sdk/features/leave-end-room)

```js
// Only one participant will leave/exit the meeting; the rest of the participants will remain.
room.leave();

// The meeting will come to an end for each and every participant. So, use this function in accordance with your requirements.
room.end();
```

<br/>

## [Listen for Room Events](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/api/sdk-reference/room-class/events)

By registering callback handlers, VideoSDK sends callbacks to the client app whenever there is a change or update in the meeting after a user joins.

```js
    room.on(
      Events.roomJoined,
      () {
        // This event will be emitted when a localParticipant(you) successfully joined the meeting.
      },
    );

    room.on(Events.roomLeft, (String? errorMsg) {
      // This event will be emitted when a localParticipant(you) left the meeting.
      // [errorMsg]: It will have the message if meeting was left due to some error like Network problem
    });

    room.on(Events.participantJoined, (Participant participant) {
      // This event will be emitted when a new participant joined the meeting.
      // [participant]: new participant who joined the meeting
    });

    room.on(Events.participantLeft, (participantId) => {
      // This event will be emitted when a joined participant left the meeting.
      // [participantId]: id of participant who left the meeting
    });

```

<br/>

## [Listen for Participant Events](https://docs.videosdk.live/flutter/api/sdk-reference/participant-class/events)

By registering callback handlers, VideoSDK sends callbacks to the client app whenever a participant's video, audio, or screen share stream is enabled or disabled.

```js
  participant.on(Events.streamEnabled, (Stream _stream) {
    // This event will be triggered whenever a participant's video, audio or screen share stream is enabled.
  });

  participant.on(Events.stereamDisabled, (Stream _stream) {
    // This event will be triggered whenever a participant's video, audio or screen share stream is disabled.
  });

```
